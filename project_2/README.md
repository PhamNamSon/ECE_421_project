<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Our project is dedicated to developing Rust libraries for Red-black trees and AVL trees, two self-balancing binary trees renowned for their efficiency in data structure operations. These trees maintain balance through rotations and recoloring (for Red-black trees) or by ensuring minimal height differences between branches (for AVL trees). Our goals include providing easy-to-use libraries with comprehensive documentation, focusing on simplicity, efficiency, and correctness, to empower developers to build scalable and high-performance software solutions.
